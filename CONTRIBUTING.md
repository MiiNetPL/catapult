Contributing to Catapult
========================

## Plugins

Please note that, in general, new plugins to the Catapult codebase are
not accepted. The goal is to keep the core Catapult light and include
only a consistent set of well maintained plugins that can be expected to
be of wide interest.

So, if you need a new plugin, the general suggestion is that you do that
in your own repository, maintaining and distributing it yourself. You
can add the topic "catapult-plugin" to your repository and a link to
that GitHub topic page can eventually be included in the main Catapult
website and README.
