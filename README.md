Catapult Launcher
=================

[![Test](https://github.com/otsaloma/catapult/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/otsaloma/catapult/actions)

Catapult is currently developed and tested on X/GNOME. It will likely
work on other desktop environments, but is unlikely to work as-is on
Wayland. PRs are welcome.

Catapult is Free Software released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL), see the file [`COPYING`](COPYING) for details. Small parts of the
code have been adapted from [Ulauncher][], these are indicated file-wise
in the license headers of individual files.
